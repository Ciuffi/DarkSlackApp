# DarkSlackApp

A simple app that helps you apply dark themes to slack

Its very easy to use, just drag slack into the app and it'll work!

you can download the latest build here [0.0.1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EOJal80edlLIjw7bbI_Dd1isZSVZcXgt)

## todo:
- allow the ability to reverse slack back to light without reinstalling
- Better error detection (the program will probably crash if you give it a bad url)
- just make it a little prettier
