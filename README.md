# DarkSlackApp

A simple app that helps you apply dark themes to slack

Its very easy to use, just drag slack into the app and it'll work!

## todo:
- allow the ability to reverse slack back to light without reinstalling
- Better error detection (the program will probably crash if you give it a bad url)
- just make it a little prettier
